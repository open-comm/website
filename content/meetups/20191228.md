# Meetup: Decentralized Social Networks @36C3 Leipzig Germany

**We will test, discuss and document decentralized and off the grid social networks, such as secure scuttlebutt SSCB.**

In this meetup we will test, discuss and document existing decentralized and off-the-grid social networks, such as [secure scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/).

Please bring your laptops and digital devices in order to collectively test the projects!
