# App Test Template

## Conclusion

It seems the app is unmaintained and most features do not work anymore.

## Test

We tested on several Android devices.

We were able to:

* install easily
* no verifaction of identity
* start to chat without known contacts within the Wifi LAN.

Problems:

* Bluetooth messaging didn't work at all, delayed delivery
* the picture sharing does not work at all.
  * the camera access didn't work at all
  * the add picture interface flickered
  * sending pictures doesn't create message
* Rumble can not be stopped from the UI
