qaul.net is an internet independent decentralised mesh network communication app. It enables everyday devices, such as laptops and smartphones to create a peer-to-peer ad-hoc wireless mesh network and to communicate over it. It supports both public and private text messaging, voice calls, audio broadcasts and file sharing — all in a single app.
